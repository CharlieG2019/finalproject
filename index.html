    <h1>New York Story</h1>
    <h2>By Charlie Gomez</h2>
    <p>This collage I created is about me. Basically this collage shows my lifestyle. I was born and raised in Brooklyn, New York. Also I added music symbols because everywhere I go I listen to music and I love money too. I also got a picture of a train because I take the train to go to places. Overall, I am proud of being born and raised in Brooklyn.</p>
